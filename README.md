Employee Management API - Implementation Summary
This document outlines the complete Employee CRUD system implemented using Vertical Slice Architecture with MediatR pattern.

??? Architecture Overview
The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles with Vertical Slice Architecture:

Features: Organized by business capabilities (Employee)
MediatR: Command/Query pattern for request handling
Repository Pattern: Generic repository for data access
Service Results: Consistent response handling
DTOs & ViewModels: Separation of concerns for data transfer

?? Implemented Features
1. Create Employee (POST /api/employee)
Command: AddEmployeeCommand
Handler: AddEmployeeCommandHandler
Validation: Built-in validation (First Name, Last Name, Email format, Email uniqueness)
Response: Created employee with 201 status
2. Get All Employees with Pagination (GET /api/employee)
Query: GetAllEmployeesQuery
Handler: GetAllEmployeesQueryHandler
Features:
Pagination (page number, page size)
Search functionality (by name or email)
Filter by active status
Sorting by ID
Response: Paginated list with metadata
3. Get Employee by ID (GET /api/employee/{id})
Query: GetEmployeeByIdQuery
Handler: GetEmployeeByIdQueryHandler
Validation: ID validation
Response: Employee details or 404 if not found
4. Update Employee (PUT /api/employee/{id})
Command: UpdateEmployeeCommand
Handler: UpdateEmployeeCommandHandler
Validation: All create validations + existence check + email uniqueness for other employees
Response: Updated employee details
5. Delete Employee (DELETE /api/employee/{id})
Command: DeleteEmployeeCommand
Handler: DeleteEmployeeCommandHandler
Type: Soft delete (sets IsDeleted = true)
Response: Success message
?? Data Models
Employee Entity
public class Employee : BaseEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = "";
    public string LastName { get; set; } = "";
    public string Email { get; set; } = "";
    public bool IsActive { get; set; } = true;
}
DTOs
EmployeeDto: Full employee data
CreateEmployeeDto: Employee creation data
UpdateEmployeeDto: Employee update data
PaginatedEmployeeDto: Paginated response data
ViewModels
CreateEmployeeViewModel: API request model for creation
UpdateEmployeeViewModel: API request model for updates
EmployeeViewModel: API response model with computed FullName
PaginatedEmployeesViewModel: Paginated API response model
?? Built-in Validations
Create/Update Employee:
First Name: Required, not null or whitespace
Last Name: Required, not null or whitespace
Email: Required, valid email format, unique across employees
IsActive: Boolean flag for employee status
Pagination:
Page Number: Must be greater than 0
Page Size: Must be between 1 and 100
General:
Employee ID: Must be valid integer > 0
Soft Delete: Only non-deleted employees are returned in queries
?? API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Status Codes
POST	/api/employee	Create employee	201, 400, 409, 500
GET	/api/employee	Get all employees (paginated)	200, 400, 500
GET	/api/employee/{id}	Get employee by ID	200, 400, 404, 500
PUT	/api/employee/{id}	Update employee	200, 400, 404, 409, 500
DELETE	/api/employee/{id}	Delete employee (soft)	200, 400, 404, 500
?? Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent format:

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": { /* Response data */ },
  "statusCode": 200,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
??? Technologies Used
.NET 9: Latest .NET framework
ASP.NET Core: Web API framework
Entity Framework Core: ORM with SQL Server
MediatR: Command/Query pattern implementation
Vertical Slice Architecture: Feature-based organization
Repository Pattern: Data access abstraction
Service Result Pattern: Consistent response handling
?? Key Benefits
Separation of Concerns: Clear separation between layers
Testability: Each handler can be unit tested independently
Maintainability: Features are self-contained and easy to modify
Consistency: Standardized request/response patterns
Scalability: Easy to add new features following the same pattern

?? Usage Examples
Create Employee
POST /api/employee
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
Get Employees with Pagination
GET /api/employee?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&searchTerm=john&isActive=true
Update Employee
PUT /api/employee/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
This implementation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable Employee management system following modern .NET development practices.
